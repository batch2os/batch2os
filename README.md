# batch2os
batch2os is an "operating system" (it's actually just a script that runs on top of Windows) made entirely (well, except for the files app and batbox "driver") from batch files.
Being made from batch files, you can fully customize batch2os, from text color to the "kernel". It's **open-source**.
It also has an appstore. Submit at the batch2os-appstore-repo repository.
